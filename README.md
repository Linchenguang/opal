This is the software for calculation of the reflectivity properties of the multilayer thin film coatings
Installations are available for the MacOSX and Windows operatng systems. Linux version is planned to be added in the future. 

If you use Opal for you research and make a publication that contains results obtained with it, I would appreciate if you mention usage of this software in you paper. Link to the accepted paper is greatly apreciated :) This would help me better understand impact of the software on the community.

If you have any ideas about how the software could be improved, dont hesitate to contact me.
